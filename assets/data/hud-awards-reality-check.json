    "description": "To build this table, I downloaded every annual HUD award file (CDBG, HOME, ESG, HOPWA, HTF, etc.) one year at a time, stitched them into a single ​combined_awards.csv dataset, and ran the totals you see here. Considering that tens of billions of federal dollars are at stake, it’s surprising HUD doesn’t offer a one-click, all-years download—manual collection was the only option. The merged dataset (link below) drives the percentages and unit counts shown in the “Reality Check” column, and each row also cites a national report where you can dig deeper.",
