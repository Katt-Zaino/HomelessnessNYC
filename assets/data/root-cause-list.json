    "description": "Below is a “suspects board” of possible root causes. Each percentage shows how many people in the national homeless count are linked to that factor—housing, income, health, and more. By comparing these shares with how often the same issues appear in the overall U.S. population, patterns emerge that hint at which suspects matter most. The table offers evidence to test your own conclusions. Unless noted otherwise, every number represents people.",
